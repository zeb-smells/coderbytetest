# Long Format Question
**Code submission for coderbyte test**. I ran out of time during the test.

**In the `code` directory**
 - `original_vis_mutate.py` contains what I was able to complete under the allocated time. 
 - `vis_mutate.py` is a completed version worked on in my own time.

**In order to run the project**
1. Download from github
2. `cd` to the `code` directory
3. Execute `python3 original_vis_mutate.py` or `vis_mutate.py` 

## Discrapancies
1. Registration dates are all either 01/01/1900 or 01/01/1999
2. One event doesnt have an ID
3. Lots of NaNs in patient name column of event.csv

**Thanks!**
